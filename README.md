# Redux Feedback Loop

## Your Personality is our Greatest Asset

_Duration: 20hrs_

We value you as a person who is part of our organization. At my company we believe that the strength of our company is the strength of our relationships. Help us strengthen our relationship with you, each day, by letting us ask you a series of questions that query your feelings of the company and the feelings of yourself.
